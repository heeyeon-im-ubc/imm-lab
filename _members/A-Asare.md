***Co-supervision with Deborah Giaschi***

I am PhD Candidate in the Neuroscience Graduate Program. My research interests are in human motion and depth perception. I use a variety of psychophysical and neuroimaging techniques including functional MRI to understand how developmental visual disorders like amblyopia affect these visual functions.
